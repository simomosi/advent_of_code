# Advent of Code 2022

This is my work for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).

I will focus on readability and time and space complexities computation, not on completing puzzles as fast as possible.

If you have any tip you are welcome to discuss it with me.

Enjoy, and may Santa be with you!
