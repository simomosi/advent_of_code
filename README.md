# Advent of Code

This is my work for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) program.

I will focus on readability and time and space complexities computation, not on completing puzzles as fast as possible.

If you have any tip you are welcome to discuss it with me.

Scripts must be executed in the root folder (standard configuration for Visual Studio Code IDE).

```bash
python3 2022/01/calorie_counting.py
```

Enjoy, and may Santa be with you!
